### Photography Workflow

When I first started this blog I wrote a post about how much I love using my Fujifilm X-T20. Around that time I decided to stop paying for a Creative Cloud subscription and began using my phone as a hub for all my photos. Now, several months later, I can’t see myself ever going back. To provide some context, it’s worth noting my old workflow. I previously used a Canon 6D and shot exclusively in raw, meaning that each picture was around 10-25mb in size. Whenever I had taken a set of photos I would plug my SD card and an external hard drive into my laptop, open up Lightroom and transfer everything. I would then do some batch edits to the set and would often spend some more time on my favourites. Then I would export a subset of the photos and add them to Photos for Mac to be uploaded to iCloud where I could share them with others. Finally, I had Backblaze cloud set up in use so I would usually end up leaving my laptop sitting on overnight plugged full of external drives to allow time for backups to complete.
