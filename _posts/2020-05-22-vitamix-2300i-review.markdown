Earlier this year, when I on a near-weekly mission to bake something new, I decided I wanted a high speed blender. Following a disappointing batch of macaroons, I convinced myself that the obvious reason for failure was not my technique, but rather the fact that I had not blended the already ground almonds to ensure for a smooth sweet.

Almost every “High Speed Blender Showdown”, “Top 10 High Speed Blenders” and “How to Pick the Perfect Blender” type list online identifies a Vitamix as the top pick. Bon Appetit refer to it as “The Only Blender You’ll Ever Need in Your Kitchen”.

The Vitamix 5200 is often the model being referred to. This however, appears to be only available in America. In the UK, there is no exact match of model, from my searching, your best bet is to look for one on offer that is within your price range.



The Vitamix does in fact blend ground almonds well. Shortly after we purchased one, I made a succession of successful batches of Macaroons. Whether or not the mixer deserves the credit or not is hard to say.
