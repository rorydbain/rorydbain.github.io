Last week I sold my laptop and received delivery of the new iPad Pro. I’ve a bunch of posts I want to make about the iPad, but here’s a short one for now.

I’ve been meaning to add a favicon for this blog for a while, but just never got round to it. So, this morning, whilst playing around in Procreate, I decided to draw one up. I wanted some depiction of a pizza, however all the references that I could find online were certainly not Neapolitan (the undisputed best form of pizza), so, I made my own. Here is the process as exported from Procreate - a really cool feature that lets you export a time lapse of your drawing.
