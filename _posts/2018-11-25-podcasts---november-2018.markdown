A November edition of some podcasts that I’ve been listening to recently.

### Podcasts 

#### [Dirty John](http://www.bravotv.com/dirty-john)
An interesting short series that best falls into the ‘true crime’ category. I don’t want to say too much about it but would recommend for people who like anything like “They Walk Among Us” or “Up and Vanished”.

#### [The Sourdough Podcast](https://www.thesourdoughpodcast.com)
I first heard about this podcast when I Maurizio of [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com) was on it. I wouldn’t say you learn a tonne from it but it’s pretty interesting for those who are into baking.

#### [Tools They Use](https://www.keepproductive.com/)
A podcast that interviews people about their daily tech and daily workflows. I’m a sucker for any tech podcasts so this has become another to add to the pile.

#### [West Cork](https://www.amazon.com/West-Cork/dp/B0792BWQWT) 
One of the best true crime podcast series I’ve heard. Sadly only available on Audible, however if you haven’t signed up before, you can get a free trial and cancel it after you’ve heard the podcast.

#### [Planet Money's The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator)
A spin off show from my previously listed 'Planet Money', this is a podcast served in ~10 minute episodes that have short investigations of different parts of the economy - far more interesting than it sounds.

#### [Up and Vanished](https://upandvanished.com/)
I had Up and Vanished in my first podcast list, however there is a second season available now that focuses on the disappearance of a woman from a hippie cult in Colorado. I don't think it's nearly as good as the first season, there's far more fluff and filler, but it's interesting nonetheless.
