Spotify recently released their 2018-Wrapped playlists for users. It’s a brilliant feature that I wish more services would implement. Twice in the past I’ve used Apple Music for a few months at a time. Both times I regretted it, and was then annoyed when my year-end stats missed my binge on a new album. It’s an ego-filling service whose greatest purpose is for enabling you to tell others about how good your music taste is. But, who doesn’t love to be told about a band that you never listen to until you _discover_ them yourself. 


I thought I’d write a little about my favourite releases of this year.


#### [New Light (Single), John Mayer](https://open.spotify.com/track/3bH4HzoZZFq8UpZmI2AMgV?si=EgEJOcBqQDaXfY7eGBroEA)
My first choice is only one song, but it’s a really great one. This song reminds of Los Angeles evenings, I think it’s got a very `La La Land` vibe but can’t quite place where I get that from.

#### [Leon Bridges, Good Thing](https://open.spotify.com/album/7J9fifadXb0PPSBWXctbi8?si=E8togu_YTc6yhkYaMgPACA)
This album is a significant departure from the first Leon Bridges’ early Rhythm and Blues style. I particularly like `Bad Bad News` and `Mrs`.

#### [Hill Climber, Vulfpeck](https://open.spotify.com/album/23jJjnLWnkYfK7E50Kmbcm?si=ICqiiRjPSv6LcX9IkKbJFw)
Squeezing in at the very end of the year, I haven’t turned this off since it came out. It’s maybe too early days but I think it’s my favourite Vulfpeck album yet. It’s an album I’d highly recommend listening to from start to finish.

#### [Guide My Back Home (Live), City and Color](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ykutdu7Hf0DlrK1BXK65I?si=TOJOXOaYQPmXzm57KzcKRw)
I don’t usually like live albums much but this one is different. Dallas Green has developed so much as a musician that it’s amazing to hear songs that I grew up listening to (that now seem dated, for want of a better word) performed in a more mature and emotive set.

#### [Living Room, Lawrence](https://open.spotify.com/album/0cI6FYd7CETgvwLQ8j7Y8P?si=0pEXwxPwQx-7O2naoDmpvA) 
Lawrence are a pop-funk band whose songs feel like a disney soundtrack. They are fronted by a brother-sister duo with amazing voices. I’m hoping they come across to the UK sometime as I’d love to see them live.

#### [Tom Misch, Geography](https://open.spotify.com/album/28enuddLPEA914scE6Drvk?si=MKTD9mUXQIm26vBVahxg8A) 
Tom Misch has become my current guitar idol. Every song on this album is brilliant.
