| Very strong white flour | Made from harder **wheat**, typically 13%+ in the UK. | - | A higher gluten content than softer wheats can result in tougher doughs. |
| Emmer | Ancient grain made from hard **durum wheat**, ~12% protein. Often used for pasta, sold as 00 (low extraction) flour. | Earthy flavour, creamy in texture. | Delicate gluten, but higher protein than common wheat. |
| Einkorn | Oldest ancient grain, softer member of the **wheat** family. ~11% protein. | Grassy and nutty.  | Delicate gluten structure, sticky when hydrated and quick to ferment. |
| Spelt | Ancient grain, heirloom of **wheat**, ~14% protein. Easy to digest and nutritional, more vitamins than other flours. | Milky, honey flavours | Not great for high hydrations and long rising times (acid breaks down the gluten quickly) |
