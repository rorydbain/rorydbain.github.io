I recently picked up a copy of the revised edition of `Tartine` by Elizabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson. I’ve already got the excellent `Tartine Bread`, `Tartine Number 3` and `Tartine All Day` books and have been looking forward to their latest release.

My first big bake from the book was a batch of croissants. I’ve made the hybrid naturally leavened croissants from Tartine Bread and although I was happy with them at the time, I think they could have been better and I was also curious to try this simpler, purely yeasted rendition.

The making process did not go smoothly. I drove home with the dough halfway through the bulk rise and it exploded out of its cling film wrapping. Then as the butter laminated rolls of dough cooked, all that butter started melting. There was butter everywhere.

Despite all of this, when I eventually pulled them out of the grease-laden oven, I could not have been happier with the results.
